# 🎤 Python Voice Assistant (Jarvis)

This is a **simple Python Voice Assistant** project made using `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, and `pywhatkit`.  
It listens to your voice, understands your command, and performs actions like opening websites, playing songs on YouTube, searching on Google, telling jokes, etc.

✅ Open websites like YouTube, Google, Facebook, etc.  
✅ Play any song directly on YouTube  
✅ Open local apps (like Notepad, Movies, etc.)  
✅ Simple chatbot answers (name, joke, who are you)  
✅ Exit when you say "bye" or "exit"

## 📌 Features
- ✅ Embeds Voiceflow chat into your own website  
- ✅ Easy set

up with `projectID` and `versionID`  
- ✅ Configurable target container (`div`)  
- ✅ Responsive design support  

---

## 🛠️ Requirements
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)  
- A **Voiceflow Project** with a valid `projectID`  
- Internet connection (to load the Voiceflow widget from CDN)
